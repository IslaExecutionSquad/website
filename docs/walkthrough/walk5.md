# Post-Isla Route Completion

- Upon your first Isla route completion, regardless of ending, two quality of life changes will be granted: Isla’s Room and Prologue Skip  
- Isla’s Room will appear as an icon in the bottom left of the main menu and allow immediate access to Interaction Mode. All unlocked costumes can be freely used, and unlocked emotions can be cycled between with the D-Pad’s left and right buttons.  
- Prologue Skip is a quality of life implementation added by DoubleEyepatch, unique to the English Patch version.  
    - Normally, in order to continue unlocking Schedule Mode events with your present system data after completing an ending, you would have to skip all the way through the common route, which results in a lot of wasted time, as no less than three complete Schedule Mode playthroughs are required to unlock all 69 events.  
    - Prologue Skip adds a choice that flags if an Isla route has been completed at the end of the opening scene. Simply start a new game, skip through the short 14 lines, and the choice will present itself.
