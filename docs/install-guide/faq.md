## After installing the patch I get a black screen when launching Plastic Memories.  
Most likely you’ve only downloaded the PC patch, and are trying to launch the updated game executable without patching the base game.

Or you’ve installed the wrong version of the patch. Verify that you downloaded and installed the correct patch, **PC.7z** is intended for the PC conversion and **Vita.7z** is intended for use on the physical or digital Playstation Vita release.

    [Cyrillic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrillic_script) characters in the file path will also cause this issue.

## Where can I buy Plastic Memories?

## Known Issues

* At a certain point in the game a menu may appear blurry and have some text fringing.  
* In rare cases, on PC, choices may appear washed out and transparent when skipping. To fix it, open and close the system menu.  
* A quick save created from the added choice in the prologue will return you to the title screen when attempting to load that save.  
* Screen tearing is noticeable on older systems. Open “Plastic Memories.txt” and set VSYNC to 0 to fix it.  
* Steam Deck users will experience stuttering in cutscenes if SteamOS’s frame limiter is enabled.
