   This is what the controller settings should look like.

    !!! note ""
        !!! note ""
            If using a Nintendo Switch controller check “Use Nintendo Button Layout”.
        !!! warning ""
            This will change the Steam overlay for games when a controller is connected. To revert, uncheck controller configuration. If controller issues are noticed outside of Steam uncheck controller configuration.

4. Close out of Steam Settings.  
5. On Plastic Memories’ Steam shortcut page, there should now be a Controller Layout option. Click it.  
6. This will open the Steam Controller Configurator, where you can map keyboard keys to controllers, swap buttons, and browse community configurations.  
7. Click “Browse Configs”  
8. Click “Community” and choose the configuration that matches your controller.

The provided Steam controller configurations will fix several issues with the game’s default controller configuration, such as mapping Backlog to Square/X, Fullscreen to Select, enabling mouse functionality with the Right Stick/PS4 & PS5 touchpads, and Right Trigger for Left Click. This makes interaction mode usable with a controller.

### Steam Deck: Controller Configurations

1. By default, the Steam Deck has controller remapping enabled. To access remapping/community configurations in gaming mode, find Plastic Memories in the Non-Steam section of your library.  
2. Open Plastic Memories and click the controller icon on the right side of your screen.  
3. Select the first option under “Current Layout” to choose a community layout.
