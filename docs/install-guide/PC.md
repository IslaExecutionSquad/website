Prerequisites:  
PC Conversion of the Game (For legal reasons a download link is not included in this manual.)  
K-Lite Codec Pack Basic to play video files, found [here](https://codecguide.com/download_k-lite_codec_pack_basic.htm).
Download from any of the three servers and install. The dependencies will automatically apply themselves

1. Replace the old Plastic Memories.exe with the new modified Plastic Memories.exe  
2. Copy the windata folder into the same folder that contains the Plastic Memories.exe you just replaced. If you are asked to replace any files, do so.  
3. Run the game.[^1] [^2]

    <!-- !!! tip
        If you get an error saying, “The code execution cannot proceed because d3dx9_43.dll/XINPUT1_3.dll was not found. Reinstalling the program may fix this problem,” this means you need to install the legacy DirectX SDK, which you can find here, or Visual C++ 2015 Redistributables, found here. Be careful while installing DirectX because even though it is the official installer from Microsoft themselves, they will ask you to install a Bing Toolbar which you probably don’t want so make sure to uncheck that box during installation. -->

    <!-- !!! warning
        The game will fail to launch and show a black screen if [Cyrillic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrillic_script) characters are in the file path. -->

4. The three indications that you’ve correctly installed the patch are the window title being Plastic Memories English Patch, English system loading text, and the game booting to the MAGES logo.

    <span class="c27"> 
    Your game should boot to this logo with fireworks sounds, indicating the correct installation of K-Lite. The top left indicates the correct .exe

A video tutorial for this installation method is available here:
