## Installing with Lutris (recommended)
Prerequisites:  
PC Conversion of the Game (For legal reasons a download link is not included in this manual.)  
Lutris (installation instructions can be found [here](https://lutris.net/downloads))

1. Open Lutris, press the "\+" in the upper right corner and click "Search the Lutris website for installers".

    !!! note ""
        The installer can also be selected from the [Lutris website](https://lutris.net/games/plastic-memories/).

2. Then search for “Plastic Memories” and select it.  
3. Click Install for “PC ENG Patch” and choose what directory to install the game in. If installing on Steam Deck click "Create Steam shortcut” in the bottom right corner. Then click Install to continue.

    !!! tip ""
        Steam must be restarted for the shortcut to appear.

4. There will be a prompt to select the PC Conversion, navigate to where “**PC Port.7z**” was downloaded and select it. This file must remain compressed, Lutris will handle decompression and installation. The English Patch will automatically be downloaded by Lutris.

    !!! tip ""
        The version downloaded differs slightly from the patch on Google Drive, as it doesn’t include this manual, a teaser, and steam assets.

5. Lutris will then download the required fixes, the appropriate Wine version, and install everything. This process will take several minutes.  
6. Once Lutris finishes installing, click “Launch”.  
7. The four indications that you’ve correctly installed the patch are the window title being Plastic Memories English Patch, the game booting to the MAGES logo, sound effects working properly, and English text after selecting “New Game”. For non-Steam installs this is the end of the guide.  
8. Follow the “[Playing Through Steam](steam.md)” section of this manual to set the provided custom artwork and community controller layout.  
9. Steam Deck users will need to return to gaming mode by clicking “Return to Gaming Mode” on the desktop.   
10. Once in gaming mode navigate to the non-Steam tab in your library and launch Plastic Memories.

    !!! warning ""
        In rare instances controls may not function properly and require the game to be closed and relaunched.

11. Once in-game, open the quick settings menu by pressing the “...” button, scroll down to the performance tab (battery icon), click “Advanced View”, enable “Use Per-Game Profile”, and set the “Framerate Limit” to “OFF”. This will prevent the game from having performance problems in gaming mode.

!!! note "General Video Notes"
    !!! warning ""
        In this video the PC port is incorrectly shown and referred to as “Plamemo.7z”, the name of the file currently is “PC Port.7z”.

    !!! warning ""
        Some steps also differ slightly due to updates to the Lutris script. DirectX no longer needs to be installed, and PC.7z no longer needs to be downloaded before installation

    !!! note ""
        The prewritten install script has been removed in favor of an approved Lutris script. However if you prefer to use the script it can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/Shaggythecat/PlaMemo-Manual-Files/releases/download/1/Plastic_Memories_Lutris_Install_Script.yaml).
