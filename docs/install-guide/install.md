# Prerequisites
File extraction program ([7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html) is recommended though WinRAR works as well)

1. Download the respective patch you want to use, either PC or Vita. Ignore the other folders for now.  
2. Unzip the program.  
- If you are using 7-Zip, right click the .7z file you downloaded, hover over 7-Zip, and select Extract to “\[Name of file\]/”. A new folder that shares the same name as the .7z file should appear in the same directory containing all of the patch files. Unzipping methods will vary depending on what program you use.  
3. Follow the respective guide for the patch you downloaded and the program you’re playing it on.   

Video tutorials are linked at the end of every section.
