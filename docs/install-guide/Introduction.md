# Introduction

The purpose of this manual is to provide an all-purpose tool for installation and play of the Plastic Memories visual novel with the English patch brought to you by the Isla Execution Squad. The first part of the manual will be entirely dedicated to game and patch installation instructions, and the second part will be a detailed explanation of the game’s mechanics and traversal notes.

It is *highly* recommended that everyone read and follow the installation instructions for their chosen system in complete detail, followed by reading the “Control Options” section, as missing steps can result in losing out on large portions of the game.

While the second part isn’t written with the intent to spoil, it will contain thematic and referential spoilers, especially with regard to all available choices that can be made throughout the game as well as general explanations of what each part of the game includes. As such, it is recommended that all players follow the intended game experience as closely as possible before referring to the walkthrough.
